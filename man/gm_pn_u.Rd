\title{Calculate Risk-Neutral Probability for Up Movement (Geometric Mean)}
\usage{
gm_pn_u(u, d, r, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{Numeric. The up factor representing the relative increase in the stock price.}

\item{d}{Numeric. The down factor representing the relative decrease in the stock price.}

\item{r}{Numeric. The risk-free rate (expressed as a factor, e.g., 1.05 for 5%).}

\item{n}{Integer. The current step in the binomial tree (\code{n > 1}).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the risk-neutral probability of an up movement.
}
\description{
This function calculates the risk-neutral probability of an up movement
(\eqn{p_n^u}) in a binomial tree for geometric mean Asian option pricing.
